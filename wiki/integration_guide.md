# 🔗 Integration Guide: Connecting .NET, CODESYS, and Hardware

This guide explains how the different parts of your industrial fullstack system work together and how to connect them.

---

## 1️⃣ .NET ↔ CODESYS Communication

### 🟦 TCP Integration
- Build a TCP Server in CODESYS
- Use `TcpClient` in .NET to Send/Receive Bytes
- Example: Stream a Float from PLC to .NET Every 500 ms

### 🟧 MQTT Messaging
- Setup Mosquitto Broker Locally
- Use MQTT Pub/Sub in Both CODESYS and .NET
- Standardize Topics (e.g., `sensor/jack1/down`, `command/valve1/open`)

---

## 2️⃣ Frontend ↔ Backend
- Use **Blazor Server** to Display Live Sensor Data
- Use **SignalR** for Real-Time Updates
- Call Backend `.NET APIs` to Trigger PLC Actions

---

## 3️⃣ Computer Vision ↔ PLC
- Use OpenCVSharp to Detect Object in C#
- Send Binary Result to PLC via MQTT/TCP
- Trigger Motion Logic Based on Detection

---

## 🧠 Best Practices
- Keep Interface Specs Simple and Testable
- Log All Messages at Integration Layer
- Use Heartbeat Pings to Detect Disconnection
- Validate All External Inputs Before PLC Action
